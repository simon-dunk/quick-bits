### Chapter 4 Study Guide: Network Media

This guide covers the physical materials—wired and wireless—that carry signals between network devices. It emphasizes the technical specifications, practical applications, and key decision criteria for selecting and implementing network media.

### **Part 1: Wired Networking**

Wired networks use physical cables, which fall into two main categories: copper wire and fiber optic. The choice of cable depends on several critical factors.

#### **A. Criteria for Choosing Network Media**

When selecting a cable type, you must consider its fundamental characteristics and how they fit the network's requirements.

*   **Bandwidth Rating**: The number of bits per second (bps) a medium can transmit. This is determined by the networking technology, the encoding method used to represent bits, and the physical properties of the cable itself. When possible, choose a cable grade that supports future speed upgrades.
*   **Maximum Segment Length**: A "cable segment" is the length of cable between two powered devices, like a NIC and a switch. Signals weaken over distance, a phenomenon called **attenuation**. Exceeding the maximum segment length can result in signals that are too weak for the receiving device to interpret correctly.
*   **Interference Susceptibility**:
    *   **EMI and RFI**: Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) are external signals from motors, lights, or broadcast sources that can corrupt the data signals on copper media.
    *   **Crosstalk**: A specific form of EMI where the signal from one wire "leaks" onto an adjacent wire within the same cable bundle, potentially causing errors.
    *   **Eavesdropping**: The electromagnetic fields generated by signals on copper wire can be detected externally, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping. Fiber-optic cable, which uses light pulses, is immune to this.
*   **Cable Grade & Fire Codes**: The material of the cable's outer jacket is regulated by fire codes.
    *   **Plenum-rated (CMP)**: Coated with a fire-resistant material (like Teflon) that produces non-toxic fumes when burned. Required for use in plenum spaces (the area between a true and false ceiling used for air circulation).
    *   **Riser-rated (CMR)**: Suitable for vertical runs between floors in non-plenum spaces, such as in elevator shafts.
*   **Other Key Considerations**:
    *   **Installation**: Factors include the cable's bend radius, the cost and time to terminate (attach connectors), and the physical environment (e.g., concrete walls).
    *   **Testability**: Verifying an installation requires specialized equipment. Simple testers check basic connectivity, but **cable certifiers** perform a full battery of tests to ensure a cable meets its category standard (e.g., Cat 6).
    *   **Total Cost**: This includes the cable itself, connectors, patch panels, wall jacks, tools, testing equipment, and labor.

#### **B. Copper Cabling: Twisted-Pair (TP)**

TP cable consists of insulated copper wire pairs twisted around each other to reduce crosstalk and EMI.

*   **Unshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP)**: The most common type of LAN cabling, consisting of four wire pairs housed in a plastic sheath. UTP is categorized by the ANSI/TIA/EIA 568 standard.
    *   **Cat 5e**: An enhancement to Cat 5, it supports 1000BaseT (Gigabit Ethernet) at signaling rates up to 100 MHz.
    *   **Cat 6**: The recommended standard for new Gigabit Ethernet installations. It supports signaling rates up to 250 MHz and can handle 10GBaseT for distances under 55 meters.
    *   **Cat 6a**: "Augmented" Cat 6, specified for 10GBaseT networks up to the full 100 meters, with signaling rates up to 500 MHz.
    *   **Cat 8**: Specified for 25GBaseT and 40GBaseT networks for short distances (up to 30 meters), with signaling rates up to 2000 MHz. It is only available as a shielded cable.
*   **Shielded Twisted-Pair (STP)**: Includes a wire braid or foil wrap to provide extra protection against external interference. It's used in electrically noisy environments or for very high-bandwidth applications.

**TP Cable Plant Components:**
*   **RJ-45 Connectors**: The 8-pin plugs used to terminate TP cables.
*   **Patch Cable**: A short cable (with RJ-45 plugs on both ends) used to connect a device to a wall jack or a patch panel to a switch.
*   **RJ-45 Jack**: The female port installed in wall plates.
*   **Patch Panel**: A panel with many RJ-45 ports on the front and punchdown terminals on the back, used to terminate long cable runs in a wiring closet.
*   **Distribution Rack**: A frame (usually 19 inches wide) that holds network equipment like switches, routers, and patch panels.

#### **C. Structured Cabling (TIA/EIA 568)**

This is a set of standards that defines how to organize a cabling system for maximum performance and efficiency, based on an extended star physical topology.
*   **Work Area**: The location of user devices. Contains wall jacks and patch cables connecting devices to the jacks.
*   **Horizontal Wiring**: The cabling that runs from the work area wall jack to the telecommunications closet, terminating at a patch panel. It has a maximum length of 90 meters.
*   **Telecommunications Closet (TC)**: Also known as an **Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF)**, this closet houses the patch panels and switches for a specific floor or area.
*   **Equipment Room**: Houses major network equipment like servers and routers. A central equipment room that connects IDFs is called a **Main Distribution Frame (MDF)**.
*   **Backbone Cabling**: Interconnects IDFs and MDFs, often running vertically between floors. It is frequently fiber-optic cable due to distance and bandwidth requirements.
*   **Entrance Facility**: The location where the organization's network connects to a third-party provider, like an ISP. This is also known as the **demarcation point**.

#### **D. Terminating and Connecting UTP Cable**

*   **Wiring Standards**: The color-coded wires must be arranged in a specific order. The two standards are **TIA/EIA 568A** and **TIA/EIA 568B**. Consistency is key; a network should use only one standard throughout.
*   **Straight-Through vs. Crossover Cables**:
    *   A **straight-through cable** uses the same standard (e.g., 568B) on both ends. It is used to connect dissimilar devices (e.g., a PC to a switch).
    *   A **crossover cable** uses 568A on one end and 568B on the other. This crosses the transmit and receive wires and is used to connect similar devices (e.g., a switch to a switch, or a PC to a router).
*   **MDI vs. MDI-X**: PC NICs and routers are **MDI** (Medium Dependent Interface) devices that transmit on pins 1/2 and receive on 3/6. Hubs and switches are **MDI-X** (MDI Crossed) devices that do the opposite. This is why a straight-through cable works between a PC and a switch. Many modern devices have **auto-sensing ports** that automatically reconfigure, making crossover cables unnecessary.
*   **Differential Signals**: To mitigate noise, TP cables use **differential signals**. A bit is sent as both a positive and a negative voltage on the two wires of a pair. The receiver reads the *difference* between them, which effectively cancels out any noise that affects both wires equally.

#### **E. Fiber-Optic Cable**

Fiber-optic cable uses pulses of light, making it immune to all electrical interference (EMI/RFI) and electronic eavesdropping. It offers extremely high bandwidth and can span very long distances.

*   **Construction**: Consists of a glass or plastic **core**, surrounded by **cladding** (another layer of glass), a plastic **buffer**, Kevlar strengthening fibers, and an outer jacket.
*   **Cable Types**:
    *   **Single-Mode Fiber (SMF)**: Has a very small core (8 microns) and uses lasers as a light source. It's more expensive but can transmit data over the longest distances (up to 100 km) and is used for higher-bandwidth applications.
    *   **Multimode Fiber (MMF)**: Has a larger core (50 or 62.5 microns) and uses less expensive LEDs. It spans shorter distances (up to 2 km).
*   **Connectors**: Many types exist, including **ST** (twist-on), **SC** (push-on), and **LC** (latching, smaller for high-density). The **MT-RJ** connector is a small form-factor connector that houses two fibers.

### **Part 2: Cable Testing Equipment**

Properly testing a cable installation requires specialized tools.
*   **Cable Certifier**: The most comprehensive tool. It performs a full battery of tests to certify that a cable meets a specific category standard (e.g., Cat 6a).
*   **Basic Cable Tester**: Checks for **wiremap** (correct pinouts), shorts, and open circuits.
*   **Tone Generator and Probe**: Used to locate a specific cable in a bundle. The generator sends a tone down the wire, and the probe emits an audible sound when it touches the correct wire at the other end.
*   **Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR)**: Measures cable length and can locate breaks by sending a signal and measuring the time it takes for the reflection to return. The fiber equivalent is an **OTDR**.

### **Part 3: Wireless Networking**

Wireless networking uses the air as its medium and is often part of a **hybrid network** that includes wired components.

*   **Wireless Benefits**: Provides user mobility, extends network reach where cabling is difficult, and allows for temporary connections.
*   **Wireless LAN Components**: Wireless devices connect to a central **Access Point (AP)** or **transceiver**, which bridges the wireless and wired parts of the network.
*   **Wireless Transmission**:
    *   **Electromagnetic (EM) Spectrum**: Wireless signals are waves in the EM spectrum, measured in **hertz (Hz)**. Lower frequencies travel farther with less data, while higher frequencies carry more data over shorter distances. Wi-Fi operates in the microwave frequency bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz).
    *   **Transmission Technologies**:
        *   **Infrared (IR)**: Uses light beams and requires a clear line of sight. Susceptible to interference from light sources.
        *   **Narrowband Radio**: Uses a single, specific radio frequency, much like a police radio. Requires no line of sight but is highly susceptible to interference.
        *   **Spread-Spectrum Radio**: The technology used by Wi-Fi. It uses multiple frequencies simultaneously to improve reliability and reduce interference. Methods include **frequency hopping** and **direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)**.
